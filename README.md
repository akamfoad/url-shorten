This is my solution to the [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G "URL shortening API landing page - frontendmentor.io") challenge. I made it with using:

1. [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react/)
2. [ReduxJS](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux)
3. [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
4. [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react/)

> special thanks for [frontendmentor.io](https://github.com/frontendmentorio) for those challenges help begginers to practice on real-world examples.
